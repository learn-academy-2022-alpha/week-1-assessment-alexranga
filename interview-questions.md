# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: 
  What is git?
  A git is a software that ran locally on a computer used by developers for source code management.

  What is the difference between git and Github?
  A developer can use git without Github but cannot use Github without git. Unlike git, Github is web based and used as a network for multiple interconnected computers for source code sharing and management.


  Researched answer:
  Git is a software that is installed locally on a machine and used as a command line tool for developers to work and track different versions/branches of a code base. Github is a graphical use interface that is hosted on the web as a service cloud focused on centralized source code hosting and sharing.


2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:
  Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?
  Relational, Equality, and logical operators return a Boolean value of true meaning "yes" and false saying "no". Some of the examples of these operators are: and/or/not; greater/less than; greater/less than or equals; strict/loose equality and Not Equal.

  Researched answer:
  Boolean expressions in javascript return true or false. A Boolean value is returned when an operator: (Relational/Equality) looks for relationship between two values  (<,>,==,===,<=,=>); (Logical) takes two complete statements and chain chain them together (and, or, not).


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:
  What is an index? What is the difference between index and value? 
  In a collection of strings (array), Index is the position of a value/string. A value is the data stored in a variable. We can extract a single value from an array or a single character from a string using an index number starting with 0.


  Researched answer:
  Every value in an array has a specific location known as index. The content of each element in an array is known as the value. Arrays are 0 indexed. Since indexes are like an address, we can reference the variable that holds an entire array and the specific index in square brackets [] in order to retrieve a value.


4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:
  What is iteration?
  Iteration means looping over values until a condition is met. Running a code until the set condition is acheived.

  Researched answer:
  Iteration is the process of perorming a specific action in a certain number of times until a set condition is met as it creates a loop that is executed as long a condition is true and will only stop when the condition becomes false.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: 
  Pair programming allows two developers to review and work on codes in real-time wherein one is assigned as the driver and the other as navigator. Both interacts consistently and switch roles for efficiency. The driver sits with hands on the keyboard writing the codes while the navigator gives instructions, observe, and looking at the bigger picture.

  Researched answer:
  Pair programming includes two developers working on a single system, with one typing and the other one navigating or observing. The one responsible for typing is known as the "Driver", while the other one called the "Navigator" continually revise and review what is being coded or typed. During the whole of their time with each other, the two invariably keeps in touch, enabling the other partner to participate and help outline the code direction.
  The objective is to share the workload in order to maintain the constant development stream and also to help spread knowledge between the pair. The driver and the navigator/reviewer constantly interact throughout pair programming for efficiency.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: takes one or more functions as arguments and/or returns a function as a value from it. It either accept a function as an argument or return a function.

2. Jest: is a JavaScript test runner - a JavaScript library for creating, structuring, and running tests.

3. Objects: non-primitve data-type that store mulitple collections of data and values that consists properties.

4. Method: functions contained within an object.

5. Classes: blueprint for creating objects. Classes condense data and functions that manipulate data.
